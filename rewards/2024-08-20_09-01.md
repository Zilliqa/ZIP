# Zilliqa rewards 2024-08-20/2024-09-28

Hello,

Mining rewards remain stable; we do not propose to adjust them in August or September.

Staking reward adjustments will continue on the previously advised
schedule, with the next reduction being 1% on 2nd September 2024 and a
subsequent reduction of 1% on 1st October 2024.

October's reduction will be the final reduction approved by governance
proposal #QmVyXAm.

The new percentage of the block rewards allocated to staking rewards
will be 26% on 2nd September and 25% on 1st October.

Based on the amendment to ZIP-24, staking reward adjustment will be
done in the rewarder script and the contract parameters to be set will
be:

2nd September - `"lookup_reward_in_percent": "4000"`
1st October - `"lookup_reward_in_percent": "4000"`
