# Zilliqa rewards 2024-05-31

Hello,

Mining rewards remain stable; we do not propose to adjust them in June,

Staking reward adjustments will continue on the previously advised
schedule, with the next reduction being 1% on 31st May 2024.

The new percentage of the block rewards allocated to staking rewards
will be 29%.

Based on the amendment to ZIP-24, staking reward adjustment will be
done in the rewarder script and the contract parameters to be set will
be:

31st May - `"lookup_reward_in_percent": "4000"`
