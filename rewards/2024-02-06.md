# Zilliqa rewards 2024-02-06

We implemented the January rewards report's proposal to catch up with
staking rewards adjustments on 2024-02-16.

Mining rewards have been stable at about historical levels since
version 9.3.0 was released. We do not propose to adjust mining rewards
in February or March.

We propose to continue staking reward adjustments on schedule, but
align them to month boundaries for easier reporting.

Thus, staking rewards will change on 16th Februrary, 1st March, and
subsequently on the first working day of each month. The reward
contract parameters to be set will be:

16th Feb -  `"lookup_reward_in_percent":  "3300"`

1st March - `"lookup_reward_in_percent":  "3200"`
