# Zilliqa rewards 2024-06-28/2024-07-28

Hello,

Mining rewards remain stable; we do not propose to adjust them in July
or in August.

Staking reward adjustments will continue on the previously advised
schedule, with the next reduction being 1% on 1st July 2024 and a
subsequent reduction of 1% on 1 Aug 2024.

The new percentage of the block rewards allocated to staking rewards
will be 28% on 1 July and 27% on 1 August.

Based on the amendment to ZIP-24, staking reward adjustment will be
done in the rewarder script and the contract parameters to be set will
be:

1st July - `"lookup_reward_in_percent": "4000"`
1st August - `"lookup_reward_in_percent": "4000"`
