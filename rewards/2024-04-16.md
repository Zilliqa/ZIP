# Zilliqa rewards 2024-04-16

Hello,

Mining rewards remain stable; we do not propose to adjust them in May.

Staking reward adjustments will continue on the previously advised
schedule, with the next reduction being 1% on 2nd May 2024 (as 1st
May is a public holiday in Europe).

The resulting percentage of the block rewards allocated to staking
rewards will be 30%.

Based on the amendment to ZIP-24, the contract parameters to be set will be:

2nd May - `"lookup_reward_in_percent": "4000"`
