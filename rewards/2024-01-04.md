# Zilliqa rewards 2024-01-08

With the release of v9.3.0 of the Zilliqa blockchain, we have the opportunity to implement our reward control votes.

 1. [The staking reward reduction proposal](https://governance.zilliqa.com/#/gzil/proposal/QmVyXAms4Ln9zHQZbjhqYNg29hLeQiLpbMxJGver1udooj) proposes a 1% reduction in staking rewards from 40% to 25%. 
 2. [GP008](https://governance.zilliqa.com/#/gzil/proposal/QmQUNz5DqWnpXZ8vry7EcDLieQYjNAgaXrUaYBvyunktne) proposes active control of all rewards.

Due to the delay in software release, we've been technically unable to
change the reward percentages thus far and so we propose to get back
on track on item 1 by reducing staking rewards by 6% on Tuesday 16th
Jan 2024. The resulting staking reward value will be 34%.

There will be a further 1% reduction on Tuesday 13th Feb. Reductions
will continue at the advertised rate of 1% a month until staking
rewards reach 25% of the current level of reward.

You can check the current level of rewards via the reward control
contract at zil1hnjwuvjnjasxy230u2muceas3x4prd36d9dkev .

With regard to GP008, due to the introduction of a desharded network
with Zilliqa v9.3.0 and the large staking contract reduction this
month we do not propose to adjust reward amounts in January.

We will review reward amounts and proportions in February, when we
have data on the measured level of miner rewards in the desharded
network.
