Hello,

Mining rewards remain stable; we do not propose to adjust them in April.

Staking reward adjustments will continue on the previously advised
schedule, with the next reduction being 1% on 1 April 2024. 

The contract parameters to be set will be:

1st April - `"lookup_reward_in_percent": "3100"`
