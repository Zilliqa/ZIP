# Abstract

ZIP-11 is the Phase I extension of the seed node staking proposal as presented
in [ZIP-3](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-3.md). This new
proposal introduces a _non-custodial_ mechanism to stake tokens with a seed node
operator via a Scilla contract. Non-custodial here meaning that any tokens that
need to be staked can now be deposited directly in the contract and therefore
need not go through any intermediary entity acting as a custodian. ZIP-11 also
introduces some key changes in the staking parameters such as lifting the cap
on the total stake deposit (a consequence of the tokenomic changes as proposed
in [ZIP-9](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/zip-9/zips/zip-9.md)).

# Background

We strongly recommend readers to go through
[ZIP-3](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-3.md) and
[ZIP-9](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/zip-9/zips/zip-9.md) as they pave the foundation for the current proposal.

To summarize, ZIP-3 presents the key idea of _seed node staking_ --- a staking
mechanism to open up the _seed nodes_ for developers and the broader community.
Seed nodes are special nodes that do not participate in the consensus but
instead archive historical transaction data. Seed nodes are important to
provide services like explorer. 

The proposal put forth in ZIP-3 sets aside 5% of the mining rewards to reward
seed node operators who in return are expected to archive all historical
transaction data. The architecture assumes a set of verifiers (currently the
cardinality of the set being 1), that periodically check data availability by
periodically querying for block data for randomly chosen block heights and by
comparing the response with the one returned by a "trusted" oracle. 

In order to become a seed node operator, one has to stake a minimum of 10 mil
ZIL tokens. However, operators who cannot meet the minimum requirement on their
own have the possibility to allow other token holders to delegate their tokens
to the operator and in return earn rewards. The seed node operator may take a
commission to cover its operational expenses. 

Delegation of tokens required token holders to transfer their tokens to a
client-unique address provided by the seed node operator which pooled all the
tokens and then deposited them in a Scilla contract. The operator upon receiving
rewards (which gets distributed daily) then distributes back the reward to the
delegators in proportion to their stake.  

ZIP-9 proposes several key changes in the tokenomic design of ZIL tokens. The
most pertinent change for the proposal herein is the increase of allocation of
block reward for seed node operators from 5% to 40%.

# Design Considerations

## Non-custodial Staking

ZIP-3 (aka Seed Node Staking Phase 0) had two key limitations. The first being
that the delegation was custodial, i.e., token holders had to transfer their
holdings to a seed node operator (such as an exchange) which then deposited the
pooled tokens in a contract. The operator also collected yields on token
holders' behalf, thereby creating custody risks.

ZIP-11 (aka Seed Node Staking Phase I) aims to address this by proposing a
contract design that allows token holders to directly deposit their stake in a
contract thereby eliminating the need to send their tokens to a custodian. The
contract now takes over the accounting responsibility to keep track of tokens
delegated by each user with each seed node operator. It also computes on-chain
the reward that each delegator should get which is proportional to the number
of tokens delegated. 

>**Self-custodial or Non-Custodial?** Even though there does not seem to be a well-defined distinction between
self-custodial asset management and non-custodial management and are often used
interchangeably in the blockchain space, we argue that there is a difference
between the two. <br> <br> Notice that in both ZIP-3 and ZIP-11, assets leave the
wallet of the token holder. In case of ZIP-3, the tokens move from the holder's
wallet address to an address (unique to the holder) assigned and controlled by the operator.
Once enough tokens have been pooled together to meet the minimum stake deposit, they are
transferred to the contract. The safety of the assets
held in the contract relies on the security of the contract. <br> <br> In case of
ZIP-11, tokens holders can directly deposit their tokens into the contract by
providing the information on the address of the operator with which they wish
to stake. ZIP-11 removes the need of any intermediate addresses.  ZIP-11
therefore provides a non-custodial mechanism to delegate tokens. The
non-custodial property comes from the fact that there is no single entity that
holds the asset on behalf of holders at any point of time. Assets are either in
the hands of the holder or held in a contract on-chain the mechanics of which is transparent. This is in line with
all the DeFi applications. <br> <br> Compare this with a mechanism where assets do
not leave the holder's wallet. The holder always holds the custody of the
asset. We refer to this as _self-custody_. <br><br> ZIP-11 does not provide a
self-custodial staking mechanism but a non-custodial way to delegate tokens. 

## Uncapped Staking

The second limitation with ZIP-3 was related to the total number of tokens that
could ever be delegated. Given that only 5% of the block reward were available
to reward the operators, the more tokens get staked, the thinner the
distribution of the rewards becomes, thereby, potentially resulting in a situation where
the reward and the commission becomes so low that it could not cover the
operational expense of running a seed node. In order to tackle this issue,
ZIP-3 proposed a cap of 61 million tokens to be staked on each operator and a
total of 610 million tokens across all operators. This was to ensure that the
operator would get an yield of ~10% per year. 

However, due an excessive demand in the market, the seed node operators had to
stretch beyond the 61 million cap. Due to the custodial nature of the contract
design, it was possible for the operators to accept say 2x61 million tokens but
deposit only 61 million in the contract but dividing the reward earned from 61
million tokens to delegators contributing  2x61 million tokens, thereby reducing
the yield from ~10% to ~5% per year.

In light of this, ZIP-9 was proposed to increase the block reward allocated for
seed node rewards from 5% to 40%. With this change, it will become possible to
lift the cap of 610 million tokens and yet be able to provide a healthy yield.
ZIP-11 incorporates the change proposed in ZIP-9 thereby solving the issue of
oversubscription.

## Governance Tokens aka gZIL

This ZIP also introduces gZILs (short for _governance ZILs_). gZILs will be
ZRC-2 compliant fungible tokens that will be earned alongside staking rewards.
More concretely, whenever, a delegator decides to withdraw her stake rewards,
an equivalent number of gZILs will be minted and issued to the delegator.
Since, the reward earned is proportional to the stake deposit and the staking
duration, the number of gZILs earned will capture the long-term
belief of a token holder. In other words, the longer a delegator stakes her
tokens and the larger her stake is, the more gZILs she will earn.

gZILs will later be used to govern a DAO-like structure that will invest in
community projects. A [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)-like DAO will be setup with funds from Zilliqa
Research to fund ecosystem projects and initiatives. The end goal is to move
move all ecosystem funding currently done by Zilliqa Research (as a part of
ZILHive) to the DAO making the community responsible for making decisions on
funding ecosystem projects. The community holding gZILs will be able to vote on proposals
alongside Zilliqa Research on making decisions. More on this will be released as
a separate ZIP.

Since the purpose of gZIL will mainly be in voting in a DAO (and potentially earning benefits from the DAO), gZIL must capture
token holders that are long-term ecosystem participants with a deep-rooted
interest in making the Zilliqa ecosystem grow and succeed. Issuing gZIL
alongside staking rewards aims to capture those token holders.

The issuance curve of gZIL is hard to predict given that it depends on the
number of ZILs staked in the contract and the frequency of reward withdrawal by
token holders. Since, rewards earned are not automatically staked in a
cumulative manner, token holders will have to manually withdraw their rewards
and in doing so they will receive gZILs. gZILs will only be issued for the first 2 years after the launch of the staking contract. This is to encourage the early supporters to get involved in the staking program. 

gZIL will have no pre-defined exchange rate pegged with ZIL, i.e., gZILs cannot
be redeemed for ZILs. However, since gZILs will be needed to vote in the DAO,
we believe that a secondary market for gZIL may open up that will help with the
price discovery of gZIL. 

# Non-custodial Seed Node Staking Overview

## Staking Parameters

As proposed in [ZIP-3](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-3.md), seed node staking will not dilute the maximum token supply which remains fixed to 21 billion tokens. However, with [ZIP-9](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/zip-9/zips/zip-9.md) in place, the Zilliqa protocol will now allocate 40% of block rewards (that gets disbursed to the miners every hour or so) to reward seed nodes. The table below presents a further breakdown pre-ZIP-9 and post-ZIP-9. Note that block rewards get distributed at the end of each DS epoch. 

| Mainnet parameter  | Pre-ZIP-9 Value        | Post ZIP-9 Value |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Total mining reward distributed per DS epoch  (in ZIL) | 197,244  | 275,000 |
| Average duration of a DS epoch (in mins) | 83  | 83 |
| Number of DS epochs per day        | 17          | 17 |
| Number of DS epochs per year | 6,205 | 6,205 |
| Percentage of reward proposed for seed nodes | 5% | 40% |
| Total reward available for seed nodes per DS epoch (in ZIL) | 197,244 x 0.05 = 9,862 |275,000 x 0.4 = 110,000 |
| Total reward available for seed nodes per year (in ZIL) | 6,205 x 9,862 = 61,193,710| 6,205 x 110,000 = 682,550,000|

As shown in the table above, if 40% of block reward goes to the seed nodes, then a total of ~682 million ZILs per year can be used to provide the necessary incentives. With this total reward available, we propose the following economic parameters for staking:

| Staking parameter                           | ZIP-3 Value       | ZIP-11 Value |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |----------------- |
| Maximum overall staked amount (in ZIL)      | 610,000,000           | Uncapped         |
| Maximum stake amount (in ZIL) per seed node | 61,000,000            | Uncapped         |       
| Minimum stake amount (in ZIL) per seed node | 10,000,000            | 10,000,000              |
| Minimum stake amount (in ZIL) for delegators |        NA            | 1,000            |
| Maximum commission rate change per cycle    |        NA             | 1%               |
| Maximum number of seed nodes                | 10                    | 10               |
| Annual interest rate                        | 10.03%                | Variable         |
| Rewarding cycle                             | 17 DS blocks (~1 day) | 17 DS block (~1 day) |
| Lockup period                               |  NA                   | NA |

The rationale behind introducing a minimum stake amount for delegators is to ensure that the staked reward is not less than the gas paid to withdraw it. 

## Verifier

The role of the verifier in ZIP-11 is the same as the one in ZIP-3. The (trusted) verifier which sits off-the chain periodically checks the health of each SSN node for example by querying for random transaction data via the public APIs. For each SSN, it computes `verification_passed` which is the percentage of tests that the SSN has passed. 

The reward earned (in ZIL) by a given SSN is then computed in the following way: The computation takes into account the total reward available for seed nodes per DS epoch (which is 110,000 Cf, table above), the total number of DS epoch per reward cycle (roughly 17) and the verification success rate in percentage. This reward is then distributed in proportion to the stake deposited, hence the factor `(TotalStakeAtSSN / TotalStakeAcrossAllSSNs)`.

```ocaml
SSNRewardForCurrentCycle = floor((NumberOfDSEpochsInCurrentCycle x 110,000 * VerificationPassed)) x floor(TotalStakeAtSSN / TotalStakeAcrossAllSSNs)

```

The first part of the computation `floor(NumberOfDSEpochsInCurrentCycle x 110,000 * VerificationPassed)` is computed off-the chain, while the factor `floor(TotalStakeAtSSN / TotalStakeAcrossAllSSNs)` has to be computed on-chain using the smart contract that has the most updated data as a part of the contract state. 

The verifier computes the off-chain part as an integer value for every cycle and calls the following transition in the proxy contract to compute stake reward for each reward cycle. 

```ocaml
 transition AssignStakeReward(ssnreward_list: List SsnRewardShare, verifier_reward: Uint128)

```

The first parameter of the transition is a list of `SsnRewardShare` data type which basically is a pair of `(SSNAddress, SSNRewardForCurrentCyle)`. The second element of the pair is `floor(NumberOfDSEpochsInCurrentCycle x 110,000 * VerificationPassed)`. The transition iterates over all the SSNs and computes the factor `floor(TotalStakeAtSSN / TotalStakeAcrossAllSSNs)` and assigns reward to each SSN. A small percentage of these rewards goes to the SSN operators in the form of commission to cover operational expenses while the remaining bulk is to reward the delegators.

In the case where, the total reward meant to be distributed to the seed nodes cannot be assigned to seed nodes (owing to poor performance of any of the seed nodes or more concretely, when `VerificationPassed` is not 100% for any of the SSNs), then the left-over reward is given to the verifier. This is captured via the parameter `verifier_reward` passed in the transition.

## Seed Node Operator

We intend to start with 10 seed node operators and revisit the number in the future. Each seed node operator will have to be registered by the smart contract admin. Once registered, it can invoke the following transitions in the proxy contract:

1. `transition UpdateComm(new_rate: Uint128)` to update the commission. The contract puts some restrictions on the frequency of commission rate updates to dissuade unscrupulous operators from advertising a low commission to attract delegators and once the delegators have delegated their stake later increase the commission rate to a high value. An operator cannot change the commission twice in the same reward cycle (i.e, within a day). Finally, to avoid drastic spike or drip in the commission rate for SSN operator, the commission change rate per cycle is bounded by `maxcommchangerate`
2. `transition WithdrawComm(ssnaddr: ByStr20)` to withdraw the commission earned. 
3. `transition UpdateReceivingAddr(new_addr: ByStr20)` to update the address to receive commission.


## Delegator

Delegators can stake their ZILs by directly calling the contract. They can call the following transitions:

1. `transition DelegateStake(ssnaddr: ByStr20)` to delegate their funds to a specific SSN. As mentioned earlier, a delegator must stake a minimum of 1000 ZILs. This to ensure that the gas needed to withdraw the reward does not outweigh the reward itself. If the SSN is active (i.e., 10 mil ZILs have been already staked with this SSN and that it is already operational), then the deposited stake will be buffered for a cycle and will be included in the SSN's stake pool in the next cycle. If the SSN is inactive, then the stake amount deposited can be directly included as a part of the SSN's stake pool.1 

2. `transition WithdrawStakeRewards(ssn_operator: ByStr20)`to withdraw their stake rewards from a specific SSN and mint gZIL tokens. Re-delegation of stake rewards is manual and a two step process. First, the delegator has to withdraw the rewards and then it will have to delegate the withdrawn reward as stake. Wallet providers can make this user experience seamless. 

3. `transition WithdrawStakeAmt(ssn: ByStr20, amt: Uint128)` to withdraw a specific amount from the stake.

More details on the contract specification can be found in the [staking contract repository](https://github.com/Zilliqa/staking-contract/blob/dev/contracts/README.md).

# Limitations and Future Work

While, ZIP-11 makes improvements over ZIP-3 in terms of providing a non-custodial way for token holders to delegate their stake with an SSN. It does not address the trust component that a single verifier brings. We list below two key improvements for the next phase of seed node staking.

* **Detecting Cheating/Malicious Operators:** In **Phase 1** as in **Phase 0**, the Verifier implements rather simple checks to monitor the health of a seed node, such as checking if the seed node holds data for randomly chosen blocks and is alive when a fetch request (for a block data) is made. One possible improvement could be to implement a [Proof of Retrievability protocol](http://www.arijuels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BJO09b.pdf) - a protocol that runs between a client and a data storage provider that guarantees that the data storage provider indeed holds a certain data that the client has outsourced to the storage provider.

* **Decentralizing Verifiers:** Another area for improvement in the next phases would be to have a decentralized layer of Verifiers, where any node can potentially become a Verifier node and monitor seed nodes and report any Proof of Poor Service (or PoPS) and get rewarded for it. Such designs have been extensively explored in the past for example in [TrueBit](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~teutsch/papers/truebit.pdf).


# Backward Compatibility

The non-custodial staking will be implemented as a new contract and the older contract will be deprecated. This ZIP also introduces some backward incompatible changes inherited from ZIP-9 particularly the 40% block reward allocation.
