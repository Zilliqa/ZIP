## Abstract

ZIP-11 is the Phase I extension of the seed node staking proposal as presented in [ZIP-3](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-3.md). This new proposal introduces a non-custodial mechanism to stake tokens to a seed node operator via a Scilla contract. ZIL-11 also introduces some keys changes in staking paramaeters such as lifting the cap on the total stake deposits which is in result of the tokenomic changes proposed in [ZIP-9](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/zip-9/zips/zip-9.md).


## Backward Compatibility

The staking mechanism is intended to work alongside the existing core protocol and should be fully backward compatible with all its components, i.e., no change in behavior should be observable on the mainnet operation with this mechanism in place.
